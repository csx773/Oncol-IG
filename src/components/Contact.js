        <h3>INTRO</h3>
        <p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women. About 26% of all cancer deaths are from lung cancer.</p>
        <p>Lung Cancer is responsible for more deaths in Canada than breast, prostate and colon cancer combined.</p>

        <h3>CAUSES</h3>
        <p>Tobacco smoking is the number one cause of lung cancer. (85%-90%)</p>
        <p>Long term exposure to high concentrations of radon </p>

        <h3>SYMPTOMS</h3>
        <p>Early stages of lung cancer often have no symptoms. Because of this, most lung cancer patients already have advanced disease by the time they are diagnosed.</p>
        <p>Symptoms of advanced stages may include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>New, changing or worsening cough, especially if the sputum contains blood</li>
          <li>Change in the ability to perform exercise (e.g. shortness of breath with walking)</li>
          <li>Repeated episodes of pneumonia and/or bronchitis</li>
          <li>Fever, weakness, weight loss</li>
          <li>Chest pain</li>
          <li>Difficulty swallowing</li>
          <li>Growth of lymph nodes in the neck</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>PREVENTIONS</h3>
        <p>Donâ€™t smoke, and avoid exposure to tobacco and cigarette smoke. </p>
        <p> Quitting will reduce your cancer risk. Your risk of lung cancer decreases for each year that you haven't smoked. Ten years after quitting, the risk of dying from lung cancer is about half that of a person who is still smoking.</p>
        <p>If you live in an area where radon gas is likely, consider ways to reduce radon build up in your home.</p>
        <p>Lung cancer screening using low-dose CT scans is currently recommended by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. </p>

        <h3>TREATMENT</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Surgery</li>
          <li>Radiation Therapy</li>
          <li>Chemotherapy</li>
        </ul>
